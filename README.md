# Triple CIpher Image
 Image Distortion Creative Application

A javascript web application that takes a single image as input, which it displays in three separate moving HTML canvases.  The canvases are animated to slowly superimpose over one another.

In the separate html canvases, the images are distorted individually using a special algorithm, which on a pixel by pixel basis assigns the red value to one image, the blue to the next,
and the green to the third (creating a distorted and somewhat random appearance).  When superimposed, the original image reappears undistorted.
